This blog is going to be a little different from the updates we usually post. I want to take this opportunity to talk about one of the most important aspects of Autonomous Vehicles: Testing.

Testing is important in all aspects of engineering, but especially so in safety critical systems. Testing is vital to all aspects of designing and implementing an autonomous vehicle. And it will also be vital to proving to the rest of the world - from the general public to government regulators - that AVs are safe. However not all testing is created equal. At Varden labs we have identified three distinct kinds of testing:

- Idealized Testing: This is when the system is being tested in the best possible environment. You use idealized tests to prove that something is possible, it doesn't neccessarily show that it works consistently. Another name for this is prototyping. No one expects a prototype to work consistently or in all circumstances - that's not the point - it simply has to demonstrate that the principle *can* work. In the sphere of autonomous vehicles the DARPA Grand Challenge is a good example of an idealized test. The Grand Challenge was a 2005 race across the Mojave desert completed entirely by autonomous vehicles. Since the desert lacks intersections, traffic signals, pedestrians, other cars and adverse weather like rain and snow, a car which can complete the Grand Challenge is still a huge distance from being able to operate in the real world. However, this race proved that autonomous driving *can* be done and a huge number of the people currently working on AVs at the leading companies got their start in Grand Challenge. For many in the industry the Grand Challenge was the "aha" moment when they realized that this technology was possible, which is to say it did exactly what it was supposed to do.
