What. a. week...  Starting it off, as promised last week, 

The go-cart track:  

Last week we mentioned that we were going to be going to a go cart track and talking to the local CTV news. After an eventful morning of looking for our lost truck key, we finally got to the track a few minutes late. Having already recorded a few routes the time before, we were able to get right to it and had a local CTV personality interview us for the first hour or so. Everything was working great including all of the new features that were added, and we had a lot of fun being interveiwed. As the local CTV crew was packing up to head back to the office and edit the peice, we had Darren Harmon from [Forefront Video Tours](http://www.forefrontvideotours.com/#home) take some footage of our golf cart from the air in a quad-copter! Man, did he ever get some great video footage!

As Darren was filming, and as the local CTV crew was leaving, we had a bit of an unexpected visit from CTV National! Just like the interview from earlier in the day, they had us both talk to them about Varden Labs and took a few rides on the golf cart. The golf cart preformed spectacularly. This was the the first time that we were really able to test out our wireless e-stop and it was pperfect. We basically drove the entire day without anyone in cart, and there were no issues the whole time with any of our systems. 

The National piece will not be released until later, but that same day, the local piece aired! We managed to scrape the video off of their web page (it was a little harder than it should have been) and posted it to our youtube page.

NovAtel:

After our day at the track, the next day, we had a couple representatives from NovAtel stop by and see how we had been doing. NovAtel is a Calgary based GPS company who were nice enough to donate our entire GPS rig to us for the summer.  This has been vital for the prototype and we gratefull to call them a sponsor of the prototype.  We had the golf cart running loops around a local field and its pretty cool to just watch the vehicle drive around without anyone inside.
