title: Introducing Varden Labs
---

Hi there,

We are two kids from the University of Waterloo. We love autonomous technology and we think it is going to be revolutionary. We're young, we're naive, we don't know yet realize how hard creating an autonomous vehicle really is. That's the beauty of it. We want to take on the crazy awesome challenge of building a vehicle that can drive itself! We hope you'll join us for the ride.

We are Varden Labs.
