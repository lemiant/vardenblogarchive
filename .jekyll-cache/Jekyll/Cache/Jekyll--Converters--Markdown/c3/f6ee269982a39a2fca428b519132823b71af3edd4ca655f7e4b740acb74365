I"ü<p>It‚Äôs been a very productive first week of build. When we arrived in Calgary we immediately set to work getting our office set up. We established a small cove in the basement where we setup out laptops second monitors and our favourite BOSE speaker. Also, we have our very own workshop in the garage complete with drill press, bandsaw, mill and lathe!</p>

<p>The final key tool we needed was, of course, a whiteboard (despite all the fancy productivity tools out there, we still prefer a good whiteboard). For maximum productivity we wanted the biggest whiteboard that we could buy.  Unfortunately, large whiteboards are very expensive‚Ä¶ To combat this problem, we headed off to Home Depot where we bought a 4‚Äô x 6‚Äô sheet of plywood board which we built a couple legs for and painted with special whiteboard paint leaving us with an awesome back wall to our office.</p>

<p>With that settled we went out to go get ourselves a golf cart. After looking around at a few different options to try and find the best fit for us, we found the perfect fit. We found a nice used electric Yamaha golf car for a pretty good bargain and after trying it out for a bit, set about taking it apart to learn about how everything works:</p>

<p>The next few days were a blur of CADing, sourcing parts and machining. We‚Äôve even got our first parts, straight from the CNCs:</p>

<p>See if you can spot those parts in the screengrab below. It‚Äôs is a picture of the assembly we‚Äôre calling the ‚Äúsensor tray‚Äù. The sensor tray supports our LiDAR and GPS sensors on the front of the car. The parts in the photo are the pivots for the arms, which allow us to adjust the orientation of the sensors by sliding the mounitng points at the back up and down.</p>

<p>While Mike was busy managing the fabrication Alex worked on getting the control system ready to roll. Happily we sourced most of our sensors last term while we were in school so we were able to hit the ground running. Alex installed Linux on our control computer (not as fun as it sounds :P) and connected up our LiDAR and GPS units. For this project we are using a framework known as ROS. ROS stands for <a href="http://www.ros.org/">Robot Operating System</a>, and is used as the base for many robotics projects from little class projects all the way up to startups like Cruise Automation which are leading the autonomous space.</p>

<p>We wanted to share one really cool picture from this process. This shot was taken from the LiDAR sitting in the middle of the living room. It‚Äôs a top down visualization of the data and you can clearly make out the 3d position of couches and other objects in the room.</p>

<p>Next we will be starting assembly on some of the mechanisms and begining to try basic steering and object avoidance tasks in simulations.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre also really excited about possibly bringing a big new sponsor on board, hopefully we‚Äôll be able to tell you more about that in our next update.</p>

<p>Happy trails,</p>

<p>- Mike &amp; Alex</p>
