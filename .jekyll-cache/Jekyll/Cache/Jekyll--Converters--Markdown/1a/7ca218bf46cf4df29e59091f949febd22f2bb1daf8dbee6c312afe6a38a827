I"¾<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>We are two kids from the University of Waterloo, Michael Skupien and Alex Rodrigues. We love autonomous technology and we think it is going to be revolutionary over then next 30 years.  Together, we are embarking on a new path, and we are taking our passion for autonomy and robotics and doing something with it.  We donâ€™t yet realize how hard creating an autonomous vehicle really is but thatâ€™s the beauty of it. We love to put our all into a project and weâ€™re excited to take on the crazy awesome challenge of developing vehicles that can drive themselves! We hope youâ€™ll join us for the ride.</p>

<p>We are Varden Labs, and we are making vehicles drive themselves.</p>
